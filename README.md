## Introduce
    "Color your life, Liffic!"

Liffic is a compound word of Life and Traffic. It is a TODO app in which you can express your feelings in pictograms with short articles after completing your daily tasks, and the color of the traffic light is determined by what you complete.

    Color your sedentary daily life in the COVID-19 era.
